Intro
=====

HTML5 has all of the functions necessary to draw whatever you want, but sometimes the API leaves a little to be desired.  This module attempts to add convenience methods to the HTML5 API.

To install this module:

`npm install libcanvas`

Note: You will still need to copy the source files if you plan to use this in the browser.

This branch only has live examples.  Please read the main README in the master branch.

To see the example in action, go [here](http://beatgammit.github.com/libcanvas).

Examples
--------

There are four examples provided, with a simple node.js webserver.

* all.html- All three ways to use the library in one file
* low-level.html- Use of the low-level functions
* protoOverride.html- Overrides the drawing object prototype (**preferred**)
* wrappers.html- Using the wrapped functions
